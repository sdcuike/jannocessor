**JAnnocessor** is a new open-source framework for powerful, flexible, yet easy processing of annotated Java code. Its main purpose is compile-time, **annotation-driven source code generation** in a declarative and customizable fashion. JAnnocessor is built on top of **Java APT**, encapsulating the Java source code model in a rich and convenient high-level domain model that serves as a good target for **expressive matching and transformation**. Finally, a template engine is used for customizable **template-based** source code generation.

Having **simplicity** and **productivity** in mind, JAnnocessor offers many useful features that make it enjoyable: **smart imports** organization, logging delegation, **graphical UI** for **real-time debug**, **hot swap** of processors and templates, as well as **out-of-the-box common annotations, processors and templates**.
